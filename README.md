# Cobblemon Genetics (WIP)

A comprehensive genetics system mod for [Cobblemon](https://cobblemon.com/) that introduces advanced DNA manipulation and Pokemon breeding mechanics.

## üß¨ Overview

Cobblemon Genetics adds a sophisticated genetic system to Cobblemon, allowing players to extract, analyze, modify, and recombine Pokemon DNA to create unique Pokemon with customized traits. This mod transforms Pokemon breeding from a simple process into an advanced scientific endeavor.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Centrifuge**: Separate and purify DNA components for analysis and modification
- **DNA Splicer**: Combine genetic material from different Pokemon species to create hybrid traits
- **Genetic Condensator**: Concentrate and stabilize genetic sequences for improved breeding outcomes
- **Gestation Unit**: Uses processed DNA to create new Pokemons based on extracted DNA
- Probably more coming soon...

### Genetic Engineering
- Create Pok√©mon with specific stat distributions
- Combine abilities and traits from different species
- DNA gestation to get the rarest pok√©mon, maybe even the legendary ones (can be tweaked)
- DNA research system to unlock rarer pok√©mon, hidden abilities, color palettes, etc
- There is a chance for any gestation to fail, can be tweaked with the config files
- DNA mutation system which can be both positive and negative
- DNA storage system
