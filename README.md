# Cobblemon Genetics

A comprehensive genetics system mod for [Cobblemon](https://cobblemon.com/) that introduces advanced DNA manipulation and Pokemon breeding mechanics.

## üß¨ Overview

Cobblemon Genetics adds a sophisticated genetic system to Cobblemon, allowing players to extract, analyze, modify, and recombine Pokemon DNA to create unique Pokemon with customized traits. This mod transforms Pokemon breeding from a simple process into an advanced scientific endeavor.

## ‚ú® Features

### DNA Extraction & Analysis
- **DNA Extractor**: Extract genetic material from your Pokemon to analyze their genetic code
- **Genetic Analysis**: Discover hidden traits, potential abilities, and hereditary characteristics

### Advanced Processing Machines
- **Centrifuge**: Separate and purify DNA components for analysis and modification
- **DNA Splicer**: Combine genetic material from different Pokemon species to create hybrid traits
- **Genetic Condensator**: Concentrate and stabilize genetic sequences for improved breeding outcomes
- **Gestation Unit**: The ultimate breeding machine that uses processed DNA to create new Pokemon with engineered genetics

### Genetic Engineering
- Create Pokemon with specific stat distributions
- Combine abilities and traits from different species
- Develop Pokemon with enhanced or unique characteristics
- Preserve rare genetic traits across generations
